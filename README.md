# vim-polyglot

A collection of language packs for Vim.

One to rule them all, one to find them, one to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.

- It **won't affect your startup time**, as all files are loaded only on demand.
- It **installs 40x faster** (unparallelized), as language packs are not submoduled, but merged.
- It clones even faster as all unnecessary files are ignored (like enormous documentation from php support).
- Best syntax and indentation support. If someone releases better language pack, it will be replaced here.
- No support for esoteric languages (vim-polyglot supports modern ones like `slim` though).

## Installation

1. Install pathogen, Vundle or NeoBundle package manager.
2. Use this repository as submodule or package.

Optionally download one of the [releases](https://github.com/sheerun/vim-polyglot/releases) and unpack it directly under `~/.vim` directory.
