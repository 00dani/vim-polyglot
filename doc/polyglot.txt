You can disable vim-polyglot by putting using `g:polyglot_disabled`
option. It needs to be defined before vim-polyglot is loaded.

```
let g:polyglot_disabled = ['javascript', 'autoindent', 'sensible']
```

What can be disabled:

1. Language packs, like "javascript", "css" etc.
2. Support for detecting indentation like vim-sleuth ('autoindent')
3. Default vim settings from vim-sensible  ('sensible')
